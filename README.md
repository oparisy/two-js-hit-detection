# two.js and Browserify

## Goal

An example of hit detection in [two.js](https://two.js.org/), without DOM support.

Packaged in a browserify environment, as described in [two-js-browserify-shim](https://github.com/oparisy/two-js-browserify-shim).

## Usage

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

## TODO

* Make position detection compatible with touch interface
